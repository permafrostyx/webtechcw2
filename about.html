<p>This is the section where I talk about myself and my bad qualities<p>
<ul>
	<li>Inability to judge anything myself: I'm unable to tell if anything I do is good or bad so I just "lie" and say it went OK. I don't know who to blame for this one</li>
	<br>
	<li>Paranoia: I feel like anything I do or say will be used against me 5 or 50 years from now so I don't do anything at all. I feel like any time someone compliments me they're just trying to get me to stop being annoying or are trying to seem nicer so they can do some unspecified thing</li>
	<br>
	<li>Can't communicate: A lot of the time I just can't speak or say anything I need to, my throat closes up and if I try to say stuff I just grunt and say one or two words like the horrific stunted overgrown mantoddler I am who rots in bed all day and chews on legos</li>
	<br>
	<li>Laziness and stupid daydreaming: I prefer daydreaming over actually doing anything and I daydream 10 times about doing work before actually doing anything</li>
	<br>
	<li>Stupid suicidality: I can't even hurt myself properly to the point my sister told me to stop pretending to do it. And a lot of the thoughts seem pretty arrogant like crucifixion but others are mundane like death-by-falling-roof-tile</li>
	<br>
	<li>Making others around me upset: Anytime I try to explain myself when I make a mistake it just turns into arguing even if I try not to get overwhelmed. Then I feel bad for days and days afterwards and get worried I'm a vulnerable narcissist or something</li>
	<br>
	<li>Ugliness: When I look in the mirror it feels like every second my face changes and I look cute with fluffy hair, or I look ugly as sin with big dead fish eyes and a stupid red meaty nose and a twisted mouth and a stiff face that can't emote properly. Then I look down and see my twisted ribcage poking out of me and don't want to go outside anymore</li>
	<br>
	<li>Good qualities: It's really difficult to come up with good qualities for myself. People occasionally tell me I'm smart or kind or polite or funny or "not bad looking" but since you can't have objective proof of those things I just assume that people are being nice out of courtesy and actually hate me</li>
	<br>
<p>TLDR: I think I need to get a brain scan or something</p>
</ul>
